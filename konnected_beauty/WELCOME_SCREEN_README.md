# Welcome Screen Implementation

## Overview
The welcome screen has been implemented with a beautiful animated logo and organized code structure following clean architecture principles.

## Features

### Animated Logo
- **Step 1**: Logo starts small in the center
- **Step 2**: Logo grows larger with smooth animation
- **Step 3**: Logo shrinks and moves to top-left corner
- **Final Position**: Fixed in top-left with proper spacing

### UI Elements
- Welcome title and subtitle in French
- Language selector dropdown (currently French only)
- Two signup buttons: Salon and Influencer
- Login button with divider
- Dark theme with white accents

## Code Organization

### Core Layer
- `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart` - All text strings and animation constants
- `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart` - Dark theme configuration and text styles

### Widgets Layer
- `lib/widgets/common/animated_logo.dart` - Animated logo with custom painter
- `lib/widgets/common/language_selector.dart` - Language dropdown widget
- `lib/widgets/common/signup_button.dart` - Reusable signup button
- `lib/widgets/common/login_button.dart` - Login button with border

### Features Layer
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/welcome_screen.dart` - Main welcome screen

## Animation Details

### Logo Animation Sequence
1. **Initial State**: 60px logo in center
2. **Growth Phase**: 1500ms animation to 200px
3. **Shrink Phase**: 600ms animation to 40px + position to top-left
4. **Final State**: 40px logo fixed in top-left

### Content Animation
- Content appears with fade-in animation after logo animation completes
- Smooth 500ms opacity transition

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-language Support
- Easy to add English by updating `AppConstants`
- Language selector ready for multiple languages

### Light Mode Support
- Theme system designed for easy light mode addition
- Colors and styles centralized in `AppTheme`

### Navigation
- Placeholder functions ready for navigation to signup/login screens
- TODO comments indicate where to add navigation logic

## Usage

The welcome screen is automatically loaded as the home screen in `main.dart`. The app uses the dark theme by default and is ready for future light mode implementation.
